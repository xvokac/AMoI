Area moment of inertia (the second moment of area) and properties of plane area

Created for educational purposes.

This script is used to calculate area moments of inertia, where the area is given by a closed polygon along its perimeter. The program allows you to enter the coordinates of the closed polygon and calculates the moments of inertia to the principal axes, the coordinates of the center of gravity, and the radius of inertia. The result is displayed both in a graph and in a text output.
